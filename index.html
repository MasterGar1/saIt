		<h1>Skyrim but on a budget</h1>
		<p>
			So... hello there! This is a site dedicated to a game I will make...someday.
			For now, I can just say it will be based on a popular game: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
			I still don't know whether I will make it 2D or 3D, but I will now explain some of
			the main gameplay features.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>You will be able to see your character's hands</li>
				<figure>
					<img src="hands.png" width=700px>
					<figcaption>Something like this</figcaption>
				</figure>
			<li>You will have magic spell in one hand and a weapon in the other</li>
			<li>There will be an infinite amount of enemies spawning, getting harder and harder as you become stronger</li>
			<li>The art will be very bad</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Well that was basically it... Hope you have enjoyed my site so far. I hope soon
			I will be able to implement the gaming aspect of it.
		</p>
