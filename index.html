<h1>Insert game name here</h1>
<p>
So... hello there! This is a site dedicated to a game I will make...someday.
To be honest, for now I don't have the best of ideas as to what it will be so.
This page for now will mostly be me trying to fill the requirements not to
get a bad mark. The images I will put after this will be some random stuff,
unrelated to the project at all.
</p>

<p>
Because programming html is very painful I will now put some medicine photos
to ease the pain a little bit. :)

Well that was basically it... Hope you have enjoyed my site so far. I hope soon
I will be able to implement the gaming aspect of it.
